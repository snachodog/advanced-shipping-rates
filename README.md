# Advanced Shipping Rates for WooCommerce Configurations

This is a repository for configurations for the [Advanced Shipping Rates for WooCommerce plugin](https://www.wp-centrics.com/advanced-shipping-rates-woocommerce-free-vs-pro/), formerly known as Fish and Ships.

The folders represent USPS Zones, and inside are configurations that are for USPS Ground calculations as of May 9, 2025. The calculations in ~2 lbs. calculations due to my product weight/volume. The zones are calculated from my home zip code in northcentral Montana and will need to be adjusted from the [USPS Domestic Zone Chart](https://postcalc.usps.com/domesticzonechart).

In the top level is the flat rate volume and max weight calculation for USPS Medium and Large flat rate boxes.
